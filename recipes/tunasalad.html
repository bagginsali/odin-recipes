        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Sometimes you just want a really good, old-school tuna salad. This is my go-to recipe.
                 I start by draining the tuna well so it's not watery - this is important! - then I 
                 add a generous scoop of mayonnaise and lots of seasoning. From there, I stir in a 
                 spoonful of pickle relish for tangy sweetness, celery for crunch, and scallions for
                  onion flavor.  </p>
            <p>Finally, I add a squeeze of lemon juice and fresh parsley to brighten the whole thing up.
                 The result is a classic tuna salad that's fresh, flavorful, and easy to make. It's the 
                 only tuna salad recipe you'll ever need.
