        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>They are infinitely customizable both with different, cheesy, meaty, and/or spicy filling, 
            but you can also find gorditas with things mixed into the dough. 
            They are super-simple to make at home, all thanks to masa harina. </p>
            <p>Masa harina. It's an ingenious invention that basically makes preparing masa 
                (the backbone of much of Mexican cuisine and the primary ingredient in things like tortillas, sopes, and tamales), 
                a two- to three-ingredient affair that comes together rather quickly. This is a far cry from the traditional 
                method of grinding nixtamalized corn kernels by hand. You simply hydrate the dried corn flour to get a dough-like 
                consistency. This is more of an art than a science, so go slow with the water and add more masa harina if the 
                dough gets too wet.</p>
                <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                <h3>Papas con chorizo filling</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Salt</li>
                    <li>1 large russet potato, peeled, cut into 1/4" cubes</li>
                    <li>2 tsp. lard or vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>6 oz. Mexican chorizo, casings removed</li>
                    <li>1/2 small yellow onion, finely chopped (optional)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Gorditas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 c. masa harina (such as Maseca)</li>
                    <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
                    <li>1 1/4 to 2 c. lukewarm water</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp. lard or vegetable oil, plus more if frying</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <h4>Filling</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Generously salt a medium pot of boiling water. Add potatoes and cook until just fork-tender, 
                        5 to 7 minutes. Drain.</li>
                    <li>In a medium, heavy skillet, such as cast-iron, over medium-high heat, melt lard. 
                        Add chorizo and immediately start breaking up into small pieces. Cook, continuing
                         to break up sausage, until crumbled, cooked through, and beginning to brown, 6 to
                          8 minutes. Add onions (if using) and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent
                           and softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add potatoes and cook, tossing carefully so as to not break up potatoes, until 
                        slightly crisp, about 5 minutes; set aside until ready to use.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Gorditas</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl, whisk masa harina and salt. Very slowly add water and mix with
                         your hands until a dough forms and is the consistency of a slightly dryer version
                          of Play-Doh (the amount of water depends on your brand of masa harina, so slowly add).</li>
                          <li>Gently work lard into dough with your hands until incorporated. Cover bowl with a 
                            kitchen towel and let sit 15 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Portion dough to desired size of gorditas, though I'd recommend making
                                 no more than 8 with this batch.</li>
                            <li>Using a tortilla press or the bottom of a well greased flat plate or baking dish,
                                 press gorditas into rounds about 1/4" thick.</li>
                            <li><strong>For toasting:</strong> Preheat a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Working in batches,
                                 arrange gorditas in pan so they don't overcrowd. Cook, turning once, until lightly
                                  browned and crispy on the outside and have puffed up slightly, 2 to 3 minutes per
                                   side. Transfer to a plate.</li>
                            <li><strong>For frying:</strong> In a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat, melt lard or pour in oil 
                                to cover bottom of skillet. Working in batches, arrange gorditas in pan so they don't overcrowd. 
                                Fry, turning once, until puffed up, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper 
                                towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
                                <li>Once cool enough to handle, carefully slice open gorditas about two-thirds of the way through. 
                                    Stuff with chorizo filling.</li>
                </ol>
