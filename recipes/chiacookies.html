        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Chia seed cookies are so simple to prepare with fewer ingredients. It is just a combination of whole wheat flour,
                 sugar, and oil. I would not say this cookie is healthy. However, this recipe can be prepared with whole wheat 
                 without baking powder or soda. I used dark brown sugar and whole wheat, which turned my cookie brown. The cookie
                  will be light in color if you use white sugar. </p>
            <p>Fresh rosemary or dried herbs with olive oil would make an excellent combination in the cookie. If adding herbs, 
                add more salt and avoid vanilla extract. According to Healthline, chia seeds are
                Despite their tiny size, chia seeds are highly nutritious. They contain fiber, protein, omega-3 fatty acids, 
                and various micronutrients.</p>
